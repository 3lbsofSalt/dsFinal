This is a final project done for a data science class (Data Science in Practice) taught at Utah State University.

The project was designed by our team to meet a set of requirements, but was designed by our team to be a unique project exploring a novel space.
The topic was correlation of mood to weather, particularly rain. The mood metric was obtained by analyzing a number of tweets by sentiment and
correlating information found in the bio with geolocation and weather.
